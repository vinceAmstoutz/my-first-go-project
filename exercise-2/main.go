// The aim of this program is to create a guessing game where the user tries to find a mystery number chosen in advance by the program.
// The aim is to master the basics of Go, such as loops, conditions and user interaction.

// What the program should contain :
// - A number to guess: A fixed number (e.g. 42) that the user must guess.
// - Welcome messages: Instructions to tell the user how to play.
// - A trial counter: A variable that counts the number of attempts.
// - Game loop: A loop that continues until the mystery number is found.
// - Comparisons: Clues (larger or smaller) to guide the user.
// - Victory message: A message congratulating the user with the number of trials used.
