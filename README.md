# My First Go Project

[![Static analysis](https://github.com/vinceAmstoutz/my-first-go-project/actions/workflows/static.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/vinceAmstoutz/my-first-go-project/actions/workflows/static.yaml)

Welcome to my first Go project! ðŸŽ‰ 

This repository is inspired by the [Learn Go](https://go.dev/learn/) guide and offers a hands-on approach to mastering Go through exercises and practical experience.

In addition, I have completed the [Tour of Go](https://go.dev/tour/), which helped deepen my understanding of key concepts such as slices, maps, structs, interfaces, typed parameters, and **goroutines**, among others.


## About the Project

This repository contains a series of exercises aimed at building and strengthening Go programming skills. 

Each exercise includes both the problem statement and its implementation, all located in the corresponding `main.go` files.

The project also integrates code quality tools through **golangci/golangci-lint-action** (see [.github/workflows/static.yaml](.github/workflows/static.yaml) for details). Under the hood, it leverages tools like `gofmt`, `govet`, `staticcheck`, and others. For additional configuration details, you can refer to [.golangci.yml](.golangci.yml).

> [!NOTE]
> This project is experimental and primarily intended for learning and exploration purposes.
> Expect frequent updates, potential breaking changes, and evolving code as the exercises and solutions are refined.

## Why Go?

Go is a modern programming language known for its simplicity, efficiency, and powerful concurrency features. This project is an opportunity to:

- Understand Goâ€™s syntax and structure.
- Explore Goâ€™s standard library.
- Practice problem-solving and algorithm implementation.

## Resources

- [Learn Go](https://go.dev/learn/) - A great starting point for Go enthusiasts.
- [Go Documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/std) - Dive deep into Go's standard library.
- [Tour of Go](https://go.dev/tour/) - An interactive introduction to Go in four sections. Each section concludes with a few exercises so you can practice what you've learned.
